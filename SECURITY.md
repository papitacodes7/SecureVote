# SecureVote Security Architecture

## Overview

SecureVote implements a hybrid approach to secure voting that combines blockchain transparency with cryptographic privacy protection. The system prevents double voting while maintaining voter anonymity and providing verifiable results.

## Threat Model

### Threats Addressed

1. **Double Voting (Replay Attacks)**
   - **Threat**: Voters attempting to cast multiple votes
   - **Mitigation**: One-time token system with on-chain verification
   - **Implementation**: SHA256 hashes of tokens stored on blockchain, marked as used after first use

2. **Vote Tampering**
   - **Threat**: Modification of votes in transit or storage
   - **Mitigation**: Cryptographic hashing and blockchain immutability
   - **Implementation**: AES-GCM encrypted ballots with SHA256 integrity hashes

3. **Voter Coercion/Vote Buying**
   - **Threat**: Voters forced to reveal their votes
   - **Mitigation**: Ballot encryption with voter-controlled keys
   - **Implementation**: Client-side AES-GCM encryption with 256-bit keys

4. **Election Manipulation**
   - **Threat**: Unauthorized result tampering
   - **Mitigation**: Transparent audit trail and cryptographic tally verification
   - **Implementation**: Public ballot hashes + admin-published tally hashes

5. **Spoofing/Impersonation**
   - **Threat**: Unauthorized voting on behalf of others
   - **Mitigation**: Cryptographically secure token distribution
   - **Implementation**: 256-bit entropy tokens with proper distribution controls

### Assumptions

- **Trusted Setup**: Token generation and initial distribution happen in a secure environment
- **Voter Responsibility**: Voters must keep their encryption keys private and secure
- **Network Security**: Communication channels (HTTPS, WSS) are secured
- **Client Security**: Voter devices are not compromised during voting process

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Token Generation
```
Token = SecureRandom(256 bits)
TokenHash = SHA256(Token)
```
- **Entropy**: 256 bits of cryptographically secure randomness
- **Validation**: Minimum 70% unique bytes to ensure proper entropy
- **Format**: Hex-encoded with 0x prefix (66 characters total)

### Ballot Encryption
```
Key = AES-GCM-256.GenerateKey()
IV = SecureRandom(96 bits)
EncryptedBallot = AES-GCM-256.Encrypt(Ballot, Key, IV)
BallotHash = SHA256(EncryptedBallot)
```
- **Algorithm**: AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **IV**: 96-bit random initialization vector
- **Authentication**: GCM provides built-in authentication

### On-Chain Storage
```
Smart Contract Stores:
- TokenHash (32 bytes)
- BallotHash (32 bytes)  
- Timestamp (uint256)
- VoterAddress (20 bytes)
```
- **Privacy**: Only hashes stored, not original data
- **Integrity**: Blockchain immutability guarantees

## Security Controls

### Client-Side Controls

1. **Token Validation**
   - Format verification (hex pattern matching)
   - Entropy validation (uniqueness check)
   - Length validation (exactly 64 hex characters)

2. **Encryption Key Management**
   - Keys generated client-side only
   - Never transmitted over network
   - Displayed to user for backup

3. **Input Validation**
   - Ballot data sanitization
   - Token format verification
   - Election ID validation

### Smart Contract Controls

1. **Access Control**
   - Only election admins can publish tallies
   - Owner-only emergency functions
   - Time-based voting windows

2. **State Verification**
   - Token usage tracking
   - Election state validation
   - Duplicate vote prevention

3. **Event Logging**
   - All votes generate events
   - Transparent audit trail
   - Timestamped records

## Attack Resistance

### Double Voting Prevention
- **Primary**: Token hash marking in smart contract
- **Secondary**: Client-side token usage checking
- **Tertiary**: Event log analysis for anomaly detection

### Privacy Protection
- **Ballot Content**: AES-GCM encryption with voter-controlled keys
- **Voter Identity**: Only wallet addresses recorded, not personal info
- **Vote Linkage**: Hash-based storage prevents direct vote content access

### Result Integrity
- **Transparent Hashes**: All ballot hashes publicly verifiable
- **Tally Verification**: Admin-published tally hashes for result verification
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history on blockchain

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR/Data Privacy
- **Minimal Data**: Only cryptographic hashes stored
- **Right to Erasure**: Not applicable to blockchain data (design consideration)
- **Anonymization**: Personal data separated from voting records

### Election Security Standards
- **Verifiability**: Individual and universal verification possible
- **Secrecy**: Ballot encryption protects vote privacy
- **Integrity**: Cryptographic guarantees prevent tampering

## Operational Security

### Token Distribution
- **Generation**: Use hardware security modules when possible
- **Distribution**: Secure channels (registered mail, in-person)
- **Validation**: Recipients verify token format before voting

### Key Management
- **Voter Keys**: Generated client-side, never transmitted
- **Admin Keys**: Hardware wallet recommended for contract interactions
- **Recovery**: No key recovery mechanism (by design for security)

### Monitoring
- **Real-time**: Monitor for unusual voting patterns
- **Post-election**: Full audit of blockchain transactions
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag suspicious wallet behaviors

## Known Limitations

1. **Quantum Resistance**: Current crypto not quantum-safe (AES-256, SHA-256)
2. **Client Compromise**: Cannot protect against fully compromised devices
3. **Social Engineering**: Cannot prevent all forms of voter coercion
4. **Key Loss**: No recovery mechanism for lost encryption keys
5. **Gas Fees**: Blockchain transactions require payment (cost barrier)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Upgrade to quantum-resistant algorithms
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enhanced privacy without losing verifiability  
3. **Homomorphic Encryption**: Enable encrypted vote tallying
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Additional voter verification layers
5. **Decentralized Identity**: Integration with blockchain-based ID systems

## Audit Recommendations

1. **Code Review**: Independent security audit of smart contracts
2. **Penetration Testing**: Comprehensive system testing
3. **Cryptographic Review**: Verification of crypto implementation
4. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of key security properties
5. **Operational Review**: Assessment of deployment and operational procedures
